Music Shelf - a MeeGo music player
==================================
by Martin Grimme

This project is the successor to my popular application MediaBox Media Center
on Nokia's Maemo devices.

Heart of the application is the mediabox-core, a set of classes that build
upon the know-how I was able to collect with MediaBox within several years of
developing for Maemo devices.
